# NERV - NixOS Kubernetes GitOps Platform

> A declarative, secure, and energy-efficient Kubernetes platform built with NixOS flakes and GitOps principles.

## Overview

NERV is a modern infrastructure platform that combines NixOS's declarative configuration management with Kubernetes orchestration and GitOps workflows. The project enables rapid deployment of NixOS nodes into a Kubernetes cluster with minimal manual intervention. This is a learning project and is in a lab environment.

**Planned Features:**
- **One-click deployment** via NixOS-Anywhere
- **Secure by default** with SOPS-based secret management
- **GitOps-driven** cluster management
- **Energy efficient** design principles
- **Modular architecture** for easy maintenance

## Roadmap

- [ ] Basic NixOS flake structure
- [ ] NixOS-Anywhere deployment pipeline
- [ ] SOPS secret management integration
- [ ] Core Kubernetes cluster setup
- [ ] GitOps workflow implementation
- [ ] Advanced services deployment
- [ ] Monitoring and observability
- [ ] High availability configuration
