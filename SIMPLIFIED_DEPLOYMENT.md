# Simplified NERV Platform Deployment

## Overview of Simplifications

The platform has been simplified to reduce complexity while maintaining enterprise practices:

### Key Changes Applied:

1. **Simplified Flux Bootstrap**
   - Removed complex systemd health checking
   - Flux now self-manages via standard manifests
   - Faster, more reliable startup

2. **Centralized Configuration**
   - All platform settings in `config/platform-config.yaml`
   - Services use ConfigMaps instead of hardcoded values
   - Single source of truth for network/DNS settings

3. **Eliminated Hard Dependencies**
   - Services deploy in parallel instead of sequential
   - Self-healing through Kubernetes native mechanisms
   - Faster cluster convergence

4. **DNS-Based Service Discovery**
   - Added external-dns for automated DNS management
   - Services use DNS names instead of static IPs
   - Easier multi-node scaling

5. **Standardized Resource Patterns**
   - Template-based service deployment
   - Consistent security contexts and resource limits
   - Enterprise-ready monitoring integration

## Deployment Process

### 1. Quick Deploy (Unchanged)
```bash
nixos-anywhere --extra-files ~/secrets \
               --flake ./infrastructure/nixos#misato \
               root@<target-ip>
```

### 2. Verify Simplified Stack
```bash
# Check parallel deployment convergence
kubectl get helmreleases -A

# Verify centralized config
kubectl get configmap nerv-platform-config -n flux-system -o yaml

# Check DNS automation
kubectl get pods -n external-dns-system

# Test service discovery
nslookup traefik.nerv.local
```

## Architecture Benefits

### Before (Complex)
- Sequential service dependencies
- Hardcoded configuration scattered across files
- Custom Flux bootstrap with manual health checks
- Static IP-based service discovery

### After (Simplified)
- Parallel service deployment with self-healing
- Centralized configuration management
- Standard Flux patterns with GitOps best practices
- DNS-based service discovery with automation

## Next Phase Ready

With these simplifications, you can now safely proceed with:

1. **DNS Integration** - external-dns is ready for your local DNS server
2. **Monitoring Stack** - Use the standard template for Prometheus/Grafana
3. **Application Workloads** - Clean foundation for production services
4. **Multi-node Scaling** - DNS-based discovery supports cluster growth

## Enterprise Learning Outcomes

✅ **GitOps Patterns** - Standard Flux deployment with proper separation of concerns  
✅ **Configuration Management** - Centralized config with environment-specific overlays  
✅ **Service Discovery** - DNS-based patterns that scale beyond single nodes  
✅ **Dependency Management** - Loose coupling with self-healing capabilities  
✅ **Security Practices** - Consistent RBAC, security contexts, and secret management  

The platform now follows cloud-native best practices while remaining educational and maintainable.
