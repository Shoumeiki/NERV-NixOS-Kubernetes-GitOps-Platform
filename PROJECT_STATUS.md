## Technical Debt & Issues

### **Critical**
- *None currently identified*

### **High Priority**
- Certificate manager ACME HTTP-01 challenge routing through Traefik
- Longhorn storage class not yet set as cluster default
- Missing cluster DNS resolution testing

### **Medium Priority**
- Prometheus ServiceMonitor configurations need validation
- Network policies require end-to-end connectivity testing
- Resource quotas need usage monitoring setup

### **Low Priority**
- Dashboard UI access optimization
- Log aggregation and rotation policies
- Backup scheduling automation

## Next Steps & Roadmap

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Validate Traefik Configuration**
   - Test ingress controller deployment and routing
   - Verify LoadBalancer service accessibility
   - Confirm dashboard UI availability

2. **Complete Certificate Management**
   - Debug ACME challenge routing through Traefik
   - Test staging issuer certificate provisioning
   - Validate production certificate workflow

3. **Storage System Validation**
   - Verify Longhorn deployment and storage class creation
   - Test persistent volume provisioning and mounting
   - Confirm NixOS compatibility fixes are working

### **Short Term**
